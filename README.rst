This repository extends the Python 3 port of ManPy by Data Revenue GmbH (https://github.com/datarevenue-berlin/manpy)

We did the following modifications/additions:

Workflow 
=====

1. Before you add a feature, create a new issue with a short explanation of the new feature.
2. Create a feature branch for the issue with an appropriate name.
3. When the feature is finished, merge the main branch into the feature branch. This makes the next step much easier.
4. Open a pull request an assign it to another developer.
5. After the pull request is closed and the feature branch is merged to the main branch, the issue can be closed.
